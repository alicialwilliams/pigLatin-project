# Kenzie Academy Challenge: Pig Latin

Follow the instructions provided on `my.kenzie.academy` for this challenge. The `code.js` file is a placeholder. Feel free to rename it or add additional files to the project.

Customize this README.md however you want to turn it into documentation for your project (including deleting these opening paragraphs). The only required section is **Reflection**, but if you used a unit testing framework, also fill in the **Running the Unit Tests** section. Be sure to use proper Markdown syntax in this file (here's a [cheatsheet PDF](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf) of the basic syntax).

## Running the Unit Tests

_(To install mocha:  type npm install --save-dev mocha in terminal.  To run test: type -  npm test in terminal.
The function tested are in pureFunctions.js)_

## Reflection

For a software developer, what are the benefits of good unit tests? Are there any drawbacks to writing unit tests?

_(The benefits are that there are less bugs in your code the drawbacks are that it takes time and practice to learn how to write the most detailed test. )_
